# Biodiversity in National Parks
 
# Summary:
    This is an exploration of National Parks' biodiversity and the conservation of animal and plants. We will investigate the conservation statuses of the species and look for any patterns of species that become endangered. We find mammals and birds to show the highest rates of being endangered. Vascular Plants are also the most abundant group and amphibians being the smallest group at the National Parks in this dataset.

# Analysis
    We assess the datasets and cleaned out duplicates. We also ordered that categorical column and renamed 'N/A' to 'Least Concern' according to International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). From here we looked into a few points of interest being:
        - Number of species in each conservation category.
        - Differences from park to park.
        - Distributions of conservation status.
        - Specific species likelihood of being endangered or of concern.
